# Minimising unproductive times in manufacturing

**Short abstract:**
This study focuses on minimizing machine idle and job waiting times in a permutational flow shop scheduling problem. By comparing tailored metrics and heuristic algorithms, the research shows that the Longest Last Front Idle Time (LLFIT) heuristic consistently outperforms others in reducing unproductive time, making it a valuable tool for production and operations management.
